              1. Information Overload
            </h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-white/80">
              Analysts are inundated with a constant stream of data from
              countless sourcesâ€”SEC filings, earnings reports, news articles,
              research papers, and internal documents. Manually sifting through
              this unstructured data is inefficient, prone to human error, and
              makes it easy to miss critical insights.

              Performing routine tasks like sentiment analysis, risk assessment,
              or peer comparison for a portfolio of stocks is a manual,
              repetitive process. This leaves less time for high-level strategic
              thinking and identifying new opportunities.

            </h3>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-white/80">
              Traditional financial tools are often rigid and disconnected. An
              analyst might use one platform for data visualization, another for
              screening, and a third for document analysis. This lack of
              integration creates friction, slows down workflows, and prevents a
              holistic view of the market.

          My process was centered on understanding the complex workflow of a
          financial analyst and designing a UI that felt powerful yet intuitive.
          The goal was to reduce cognitive load and present complex
          functionalities in a clean, accessible manner.

              I analyzed existing financial terminals and interviewed potential

              I structured the platform into four distinct but interconnected
              pillars (Chat, Agents, AI Sheets, Screening) to create a logical

              I developed low-fidelity wireframes to map out core user flows,

                Users can simply describe the type of company they're looking
                for (e.g., "undervalued tech stocks with high cash flow and low
                debt"), and the AI will generate a multi-step screening process
                to find it. Alternatively, users can build their screener
                manually.

                Each step in the screening process is customizable. Users can
                set specific lookback periods or even instruct a step to perform
                its analysis based on a specific set of uploaded documents
                (e.g., "screen for companies mentioned positively in this
                research paper").

                The output is not just a list of companies but a detailed
                analysis of each one that passed the screen. Screeners can be
                saved and scheduled to run periodically to continuously uncover
                new opportunities that fit the user's criteria.
